ICDAR
- [running] run using synth training to finish and repro results
- separate char det from word det
  - compute f-score at char level
  - find a balance that is sensible for picking threshold
  - store thresholds per character with classifier object
  - run word det on chars after filtering w/ thresholds
- repeat this for the icdar training
- clean up scoring function to not use mysterious constant

- [waiting on email] integrate Mishra's character bounding boxes to SVT
