In the spirit of repeatability, we have released the code used to
generate the main results in our paper, "End-to-end Scene Text
Recognition," K. Wang, B. Babenko, S. Belongie. ICCV 2011. We hope you
find this helpful!

This document walks through how to do three things [estimated time]:

I. [1 minute] QUICK DEMO. A simple demo of running our pre-trained
   system on an image. Note: our system was trained in the ICDAR and
   SVT settings. If your images are significantly different than the
   images found in those datasets, then re-training the system should
   make big difference in performance.

II. [hours] REPRODUCE RESULTS. A guide on how to train our system
   from scratch and reproduce the most of the results presented in the
   paper.

======================================================================
Prerequisites
======================================================================
- Install libsvm
   http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
- Install Piotr Dollar's Matlab Toolbox
   http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/

I. QUICK DEMO

This will display the result of running our system on an image.

II. REPRODUCE RESULTS
======================================================================

1. Download relevant data and run 'prep' scripts to get it into a
   common format (supported by Piotr's toolbox).

   - Identify a folder that will store all the data. We will refer to
     this as dPath. Update the globals.m file to reflect this.

   - Download ICDAR ROBUST READING (ICDAR) from,
      http://algoval.essex.ac.uk/icdar/Datasets.html#RobustReading.html
     Move downloaded files here,
      [dPath]/icdar/raw/
     After moving, the folder should look like,
      [dPath]/icdar/raw/SceneTrialTest/.
      [dPath]/icdar/raw/SceneTrialTrain/.

   - Download STROKE WIDTH TRANSFORM (SWT) output from,
      http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kai/grocr/release/swt_train.txt
      http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kai/grocr/release/swt_test.txt
     Move the swt.txt files into their respective train and test
     directories. 
      [dPath]/icdar/raw/SceneTrialTrain/
      [dPath]/icdar/raw/SceneTrialTest/
     After moving, your folder should look like, 
      [dPath]/icdar/raw/SceneTrialTrain/swt.txt    
      [dPath]/icdar/raw/SceneTrialTest/swt.txt

   - Download the pre-genereated ABBYY OCR results from,
      http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kai/grocr/release/abbyyout.tar
     Move the output files here,
      [dPath]/icdar/train/abbyy
      [dPath]/icdar/test/abbyy
      [dPath]/svt/train/abbyy      
      [dPath]/svt/test/abbyy
     After moving, the folder should look like,
      [dPath]/icdar/train/abbyy/words/.
      [dPath]/icdar/train/abbyy/wordsPad/.
      [dPath]/icdar/train/abbyy/wordsSWT/.
      [dPath]/icdar/train/abbyy/wordsSWTpad/.
      [dPath]/icdar/test/abbyy/words/.
      [dPath]/icdar/test/abbyy/wordsPad/.
      [dPath]/icdar/test/abbyy/wordsSWT/.
      [dPath]/icdar/test/abbyy/wordsSWTpad/.
      [dPath]/svt/train/abbyy/wordsPad/.
      [dPath]/svt/test/abbyy/wordsPad/.      

   - Download STREET VIEW TEXT (SVT) from,
      http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kai/svt/
     Move the img folder and xml files here,
      [dPath]/svt/raw/
     After moving, your folder should look like,    
      [dPath]/svt/raw/img/.
      [dPath]/svt/raw/test.xml    
      [dPath]/svt/raw/train.xml    

   - Download the pre-rendered synthetic character training data
     (SYNTH) from,
      http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kai/grocr/release/synth_release.zip
     Move data here,
      [dPath]/synth/
     After moving, the folder should look like,    
      [dPath]/synth/train/.
      [dPath]/synth/test/.
      [dPath]/synth/clfs/.

   - Download the Microsoft Research Cambridge Object Recognition Image
     Database from,
      http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/b94de342-60dc-45d0-830b-9f6eff91b301/default.aspx
     Move the scenes, buildings, and miscellaneous folders here,
      [dPath]/msrc/raw/
     After moving, the folder should look like,
      [dPath]/msrc/raw/scenes/.
      [dPath]/msrc/raw/scenes/countryside/.
      [dPath]/msrc/raw/scenes/office/.
      [dPath]/msrc/raw/scenes/urban/.
      [dPath]/msrc/raw/buildings/.
      [dPath]/msrc/raw/miscellaneous/.

   - Prepare the raw folders to put them into a common format

2. Pick one of the configuration settings:
  - TRAINsynth_TESTicdar_cfg.m : synthetic data for training, icdar
    for testing
  - TRAINsynth_TESTsvt_cfg.m : synthetic data for training, svt
    for testing
  - TRAINicdar_TESTicdar_cfg.m : icdar data for training, icdar
    for testing
  - TRAINicdar_TESTsvt_cfg.m : icdar data for training, svt
    for testing

3. Run code
  >> preprocessData
  >> produceResultsFromScratch(TRAINsynth_TESTsvt_cfg)
