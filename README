This code repository has the following subdirectories:

./matlab: This directory contains everything needed to reproduce most
of the results from our ICCV 2011 paper. The code in this directory is
mostly the same as what appears at
(http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kai/grocr/), but after some clean-up. Check
that directory for details.

./python: This contains a re-implementation of the matlab code into
Python. This is a work in progress.

./server: This contains code that sets up a demo web server to call
the python code and a baseline pipeline of Stroke Width Transform
(LIBCCV) with Tesseract OCR.
